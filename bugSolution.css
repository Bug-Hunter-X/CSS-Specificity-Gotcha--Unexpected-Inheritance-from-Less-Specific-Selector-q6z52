To resolve the unexpected color inheritance from the less specific selector, you can either add more weight to the selector for the red color or remove the less specific selector:

**Solution 1: Adding specificity**

Add more specificity to the `p` selector by adding a class or ID, and only apply the style to the correct paragraph element. This is often the preferred solution as it ensures you're not just overriding the specificity but providing a more contextually relevant selector.

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.my-paragraph {
  color: red;
}
```

**Solution 2: Removing the less specific selector**

If the first rule isn't necessary or there is a less conflicting way to style the `div p`, remove the first rule entirely. This is a simpler solution, but consider if you're causing a different issue by removing it.

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

By carefully reviewing the selectors used, and choosing the most appropriate approach, we solve the unexpected styling behavior.
