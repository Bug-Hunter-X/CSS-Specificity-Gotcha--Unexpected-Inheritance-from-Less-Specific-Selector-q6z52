The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior due to an uncommon specificity issue:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In most cases, one would expect the paragraph (`p`) element to be colored red, because the second rule is more specific. However, if the `div` element is not directly styled, the browser might treat the first rule as having higher specificity than the second rule due to the combination of `div` and `p` selectors. This issue is subtle and can often be missed unless one understands how specificity calculations in CSS work in such scenarios.
